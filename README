Description:
        C/C++ implementation of common ML algorithms, helper classes and
methods, using efficient algorithms and highly optimized for cache usage.
The main goal is to get a good performance on SBCs (especially Raspberry Pi Zero
and Raspberry Pi 3 B+).

TODO:
        0. Makefile
        [1. Finish the linear regression model]
        [2. Write some tests]
        3. Write linear matrix operations using efficient algorithms
        [4. Finish the logistic regression model]
        5. Stress test and optimize the existing models
